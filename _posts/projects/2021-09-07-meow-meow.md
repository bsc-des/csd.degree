Meow Meow is a mobile puzzle game in a binary, geometric, abstract world. The player learns to navigate in space and overcome optical illusions with shadows. In this flat aesthetics, the shadow is the key to a 3d space for solving the quest. Every level requires a new perspective on the gray-black-white composition. \
As a student in the special program for Computer Science and Visual Communications degree, I wanted to combine harmonically code with design. In this game I've created, the aesthetics and mechanics complete each other.
