Hagar’s final project explores the printed medium in the digital world. She created a new format of an interactive book. The book is a personal interpretation for the lyrics of “Blue Moon” by beck. It’s an illustrated story about self conflict and the loneliness it imposes on oneself. The book provides a wholesome experience, combining both print, projected animation and sound. All of them are controlled by the printed book and the reading pace of the viewer.
Hagar's mentor was Amit Trainin, an honored illustrator.
