Good Boy is a story driven 2.5D indie game, where you get to control Loup the dog's collar. That's right - you do not control the main hero, but rather manage a player-character relationship with it. Together, you and Loup the dog will have to learn co-op in order to survive in the hard new reality of a disaster struck city.\
